However, the identification of these potential reference genes in non-model organisms is challenging and is often guided by expression patterns in distantly related organisms. Here, transcriptome datasets from the diatom *Thalassiosira pseudonana* grown under replete, phosphorus-limited, iron-limited, and phosphorus and iron co-limited nutrient regimes were analyzed through literature-based searches for homologous reference genes, *k*-means clustering, and analysis of sequence counts (ASC) to identify putative reference genes. A total of 9759 genes were identified and screened for stable expression. Literature-based searches surveyed 18 generally accepted reference genes, revealing 101 homologs in *T. pseudonana* with variable expression and a wide range of mean tags per million. *k*-means analysis parsed the whole transcriptome into 15 clusters. The two most stable clusters contained 709 genes, but still had distinct patterns in expression. ASC analyses identified 179 genes that were stably expressed (posterior probability ","tags":["diatom","housekeeping genes","phytoplankton","reference gene","relative gene expression","rt-qpcr","Thalassiosira pseudonana","transcriptomics"],"title":"Identifying reference genes with stable expression from high throughput sequence data","type":"publication"}]
